 * The SIGUSR1 signal is multiplexed to support signalling multiple event
 * types. The specific reason is communicated via flags in shared memory.
 * We keep a boolean flag for each possible "reason", so that different
 * reasons can be signaled to a process concurrently.  (However, if the same
 * reason is signaled more than once nearly simultaneously, the process may
 * observe it only once.)
 *
 * Each process that wants to receive signals registers its process ID
 * in the ProcSignalSlots array. The array is indexed by backend ID to make
 * slot allocation simple, and to avoid having to search the array when you
 * know the backend ID of the process you're signalling.  (We do support
 * signalling without backend ID, but it's a bit less efficient.)
 *
 * The flags are actually declared as "volatile sig_atomic_t" for maximum
 * portability.  This should ensure that loads and stores of the flag
 * values are atomic, allowing us to dispense with any explicit locking.
