/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *                hash-join hash table structures
 *
 * Each active hashjoin has a HashJoinTable control block, which is
 * palloc'd in the executor's per-query context.  All other storage needed
 * for the hashjoin is kept in private memory contexts, two for each hashjoin.
 * This makes it easy and fast to release the storage when we don't need it
 * anymore.  (Exception: data associated with the temp files lives in the
 * per-query context too, since we always call buffile.c in that context.)
 *
 * The hashtable contexts are made children of the per-query context, ensuring
 * that they will be discarded at end of statement even if the join is
 * aborted early by an error.  (Likewise, any temporary files we make will
 * be cleaned up by the virtual file manager in event of an error.)
 *
 * Storage that should live through the entire join is allocated from the
 * "hashCxt", while storage that is only wanted for the current batch is
 * allocated in the "batchCxt".  By resetting the batchCxt at the end of
 * each batch, we free all the per-batch storage reliably and without tedium.
 *
 * During first scan of inner relation, we get its tuples from executor.
 * If nbatch > 1 then tuples that don't belong in first batch get saved
 * into inner-batch temp files. The same statements apply for the
 * first scan of the outer relation, except we write tuples to outer-batch
 * temp files.  After finishing the first scan, we do the following for
 * each remaining batch:
 *    1. Read tuples from inner batch file, load into hash buckets.
 *    2. Read tuples from outer batch file, match to hash buckets and output.
 *
 * It is possible to increase nbatch on the fly if the in-memory hash table
 * gets too big.  The hash-value-to-batch computation is arranged so that this
 * can only cause a tuple to go into a later batch than previously thought,
 * never into an earlier batch.  When we increase nbatch, we rescan the hash
 * table and dump out any tuples that are now of a later batch to the correct
 * inner batch file.  Subsequently, while reading either inner or outer batch
 * files, we might find tuples that no longer belong to the current batch;
 * if so, we just dump them out to the correct batch file.

 * If the outer relation's distribution is sufficiently nonuniform, we attempt
 * to optimize the join by treating the hash values corresponding to the outer
 * relation's MCVs specially.  Inner relation tuples matching these hash
 * values go into the "skew" hashtable instead of the main hashtable, and
 * outer relation tuples with these hash values are matched against that
 * table instead of the main one.  Thus, tuples with these hash values are
 * effectively handled as part of the first batch and will never go to disk.
 * The skew hashtable is limited to SKEW_WORK_MEM_PERCENT of the total memory
 * allowed for the join; while building the hashtables, we decrease the number
 * of MCVs being specially treated if needed to stay under this limit.
 *
 * Note: you might wonder why we look at the outer relation stats for this,
 * rather than the inner.  One reason is that the outer relation is typically
 * bigger, so we get more I/O savings by optimizing for its most common values.
 * Also, for similarly-sized relations, the planner prefers to put the more
 * uniformly distributed relation on the inside, so we're more likely to find
 * interesting skew in the outer relation.
