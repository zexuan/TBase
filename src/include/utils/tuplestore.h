 * tuplestore.h
 *      Generalized routines for temporary tuple storage.
 *
 * This module handles temporary storage of tuples for purposes such
 * as Materialize nodes, hashjoin batch files, etc.  It is essentially
 * a dumbed-down version of tuplesort.c; it does no sorting of tuples
 * but can only store and regurgitate a sequence of tuples.  However,
 * because no sort is required, it is allowed to start reading the sequence
 * before it has all been written.  This is particularly useful for cursors,
 * because it allows random access within the already-scanned portion of
 * a query without having to process the underlying scan to completion.
 * Also, it is possible to support multiple independent read pointers.
 *
 * A temporary file is used to handle the data if it exceeds the
 * space limit specified by the caller.
 *
 * Beginning in Postgres 8.2, what is stored is just MinimalTuples;
 * callers cannot expect valid system columns in regurgitated tuples.
 * Also, we have changed the API to return tuples in TupleTableSlots,
 * so that there is a check to prevent attempted access to system columns.
