/*
 * CachedPlanSource (which might better have been called CachedQuery)
 * represents a SQL query that we expect to use multiple times.  It stores
 * the query source text, the raw parse tree, and the analyzed-and-rewritten
 * query tree, as well as adjunct data.  Cache invalidation can happen as a
 * result of DDL affecting objects used by the query.  In that case we discard
 * the analyzed-and-rewritten query tree, and rebuild it when next needed.
 *
 * An actual execution plan, represented by CachedPlan, is derived from the
 * CachedPlanSource when we need to execute the query.  The plan could be
 * either generic (usable with any set of plan parameters) or custom (for a
 * specific set of parameters).  plancache.c contains the logic that decides
 * which way to do it for any particular execution.  If we are using a generic
 * cached plan then it is meant to be re-used across multiple executions, so
 * callers must always treat CachedPlans as read-only.
 *
 * Once successfully built and "saved", CachedPlanSources typically live
 * for the life of the backend, although they can be dropped explicitly.
 * CachedPlans are reference-counted and go away automatically when the last
 * reference is dropped.  A CachedPlan can outlive the CachedPlanSource it
 * was created from.
 *
 * An "unsaved" CachedPlanSource can be used for generating plans, but it
 * lives in transient storage and will not be updated in response to sinval
 * events.
 *
 * CachedPlans made from saved CachedPlanSources are likewise in permanent
 * storage, so to avoid memory leaks, the reference-counted references to them
 * must be held in permanent data structures or ResourceOwners.  CachedPlans
 * made from unsaved CachedPlanSources are in children of the caller's
 * memory context, so references to them should not be longer-lived than
 * that context.  (Reference counting is somewhat pro forma in that case,
 * though it may be useful if the CachedPlan can be discarded early.)
 *
 * A CachedPlanSource has two associated memory contexts: one that holds the
 * struct itself, the query source text and the raw parse tree, and another
 * context that holds the rewritten query tree and associated data.  This
 * allows the query tree to be discarded easily when it is invalidated.
 *
 * Some callers wish to use the CachedPlan API even with one-shot queries
 * that have no reason to be saved at all.  We therefore support a "oneshot"
 * variant that does no data copying or invalidation checking.  In this case
 * there are no separate memory contexts: the CachedPlanSource struct and
 * all subsidiary data live in the caller's CurrentMemoryContext, and there
 * is no way to free memory short of clearing that entire context.  A oneshot
 * plan is always treated as unsaved.
 *
 * Note: the string referenced by commandTag is not subsidiary storage;
 * it is assumed to be a compile-time-constant string.  As with portals,
 * commandTag shall be NULL if and only if the original query string (before
 * rewriting) was an empty string.
