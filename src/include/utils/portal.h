 * portal.h
 *      POSTGRES portal definitions.
 *
 * A portal is an abstraction which represents the execution state of
 * a running or runnable query.  Portals support both SQL-level CURSORs
 * and protocol-level portals.
 *
 * Scrolling (nonsequential access) and suspension of execution are allowed
 * only for portals that contain a single SELECT-type query.  We do not want
 * to let the client suspend an update-type query partway through!    Because
 * the query rewriter does not allow arbitrary ON SELECT rewrite rules,
 * only queries that were originally update-type could produce multiple
 * plan trees; so the restriction to a single query is not a problem
 * in practice.
 *
 * For SQL cursors, we support three kinds of scroll behavior:
 *
 * (1) Neither NO SCROLL nor SCROLL was specified: to remain backward
 *       compatible, we allow backward fetches here, unless it would
 *       impose additional runtime overhead to do so.
 *
 * (2) NO SCROLL was specified: don't allow any backward fetches.
 *
 * (3) SCROLL was specified: allow all kinds of backward fetches, even
 *       if we need to take a performance hit to do so.  (The planner sticks
 *       a Materialize node atop the query plan if needed.)
 *
 * Case #1 is converted to #2 or #3 by looking at the query itself and
 * determining if scrollability can be supported without additional
 * overhead.
 *
 * Protocol-level portals have no nonsequential-fetch API and so the
 * distinction doesn't matter for them.  They are always initialized
 * to look like NO SCROLL cursors.

/*
 * We have several execution strategies for Portals, depending on what
 * query or queries are to be executed.  (Note: in all cases, a Portal
 * executes just a single source-SQL query, and thus produces just a
 * single result from the user's viewpoint.  However, the rule rewriter
 * may expand the single source query to zero or many actual queries.)
 *
 * PORTAL_ONE_SELECT: the portal contains one single SELECT query.  We run
 * the Executor incrementally as results are demanded.  This strategy also
 * supports holdable cursors (the Executor results can be dumped into a
 * tuplestore for access after transaction completion).
 *
 * PORTAL_ONE_RETURNING: the portal contains a single INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
 * query with a RETURNING clause (plus possibly auxiliary queries added by
 * rule rewriting).  On first execution, we run the portal to completion
 * and dump the primary query's results into the portal tuplestore; the
 * results are then returned to the client as demanded.  (We can't support
 * suspension of the query partway through, because the AFTER TRIGGER code
 * can't cope, and also because we don't want to risk failing to execute
 * all the auxiliary queries.)
 *
 * PORTAL_ONE_MOD_WITH: the portal contains one single SELECT query, but
 * it has data-modifying CTEs.  This is currently treated the same as the
 * PORTAL_ONE_RETURNING case because of the possibility of needing to fire
 * triggers.  It may act more like PORTAL_ONE_SELECT in future.
 *
 * PORTAL_UTIL_SELECT: the portal contains a utility statement that returns
 * a SELECT-like result (for example, EXPLAIN or SHOW).  On first execution,
 * we run the statement and dump its results into the portal tuplestore;
 * the results are then returned to the client as demanded.
 *
 * PORTAL_MULTI_QUERY: all other cases.  Here, we do not support partial
 * execution: the portal's queries will be run to completion on first call.
