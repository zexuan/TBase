 * postgres_ext.h
 *
 *       This file contains declarations of things that are visible everywhere
 *    in PostgreSQL *and* are visible to clients of frontend interface libraries.
 *    For example, the Oid type is part of the API of libpq and other libraries.
 *
 *       Declarations which are specific to a particular interface should
 *    go in the header file for that interface (such as libpq-fe.h).  This
 *    file is only for fundamental Postgres declarations.
 *
 *       User-written C functions don't count as "external to Postgres."
 *    Those function much as local modifications to the backend itself, and
 *    use header files that are otherwise internal to Postgres to interface
 *    with the backend.
