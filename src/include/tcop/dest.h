 * dest.h
 *      support for communication destinations
 *
 * Whenever the backend executes a query that returns tuples, the results
 * have to go someplace.  For example:
 *
 *      - stdout is the destination only when we are running a
 *        standalone backend (no postmaster) and are returning results
 *        back to an interactive user.
 *
 *      - a remote process is the destination when we are
 *        running a backend with a frontend and the frontend executes
 *        PQexec() or PQfn().  In this case, the results are sent
 *        to the frontend via the functions in backend/libpq.
 *
 *      - DestNone is the destination when the system executes
 *        a query internally.  The results are discarded.
 *
 * dest.c defines three functions that implement destination management:
 *
 * BeginCommand: initialize the destination at start of command.
 * CreateDestReceiver: return a pointer to a struct of destination-specific
 * receiver functions.
 * EndCommand: clean up the destination at end of command.
 *
 * BeginCommand/EndCommand are executed once per received SQL query.
 *
 * CreateDestReceiver returns a receiver object appropriate to the specified
 * destination.  The executor, as well as utility statements that can return
 * tuples, are passed the resulting DestReceiver* pointer.  Each executor run
 * or utility execution calls the receiver's rStartup method, then the
 * receiveSlot method (zero or more times), then the rShutdown method.
 * The same receiver object may be re-used multiple times; eventually it is
 * destroyed by calling its rDestroy method.
 *
 * In some cases, receiver objects require additional parameters that must
 * be passed to them after calling CreateDestReceiver.  Since the set of
 * parameters varies for different receiver types, this is not handled by
 * this module, but by direct calls from the calling code to receiver type
 * specific functions.
 *
 * The DestReceiver object returned by CreateDestReceiver may be a statically
 * allocated object (for destination types that require no local state),
 * in which case rDestroy is a no-op.  Alternatively it can be a palloc'd
 * object that has DestReceiver as its first field and contains additional
 * fields (see printtup.c for an example).  These additional fields are then
 * accessible to the DestReceiver functions by casting the DestReceiver*
 * pointer passed to them.  The palloc'd object is pfree'd by the rDestroy
 * method.  Note that the caller of CreateDestReceiver should take care to
 * do so in a memory context that is long-lived enough for the receiver
 * object not to disappear while still needed.
 *
 * Special provision: None_Receiver is a permanently available receiver
 * object for the DestNone destination.  This avoids useless creation/destroy
 * calls in portal and cursor manipulations.
