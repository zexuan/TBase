 * bgworker.h
 *        POSTGRES pluggable background workers interface
 *
 * A background worker is a process able to run arbitrary, user-supplied code,
 * including normal transactions.
 *
 * Any external module loaded via shared_preload_libraries can register a
 * worker.  Workers can also be registered dynamically at runtime.  In either
 * case, the worker process is forked from the postmaster and runs the
 * user-supplied "main" function.  This code may connect to a database and
 * run transactions.  Workers can remain active indefinitely, but will be
 * terminated if a shutdown or crash occurs.
 *
 * If the fork() call fails in the postmaster, it will try again later.  Note
 * that the failure can only be transient (fork failure due to high load,
 * memory pressure, too many processes, etc); more permanent problems, like
 * failure to connect to a database, are detected later in the worker and dealt
 * with just by having the worker exit normally. A worker which exits with
 * a return code of 0 will never be restarted and will be removed from worker
 * list. A worker which exits with a return code of 1 will be restarted after
 * the configured restart interval (unless that interval is BGW_NEVER_RESTART).
 * The TerminateBackgroundWorker() function can be used to terminate a
 * dynamically registered background worker; the worker will be sent a SIGTERM
 * and will not be restarted after it exits.  Whenever the postmaster knows
 * that a worker will not be restarted, it unregisters the worker, freeing up
 * that worker's slot for use by a new worker.
 *
 * Note that there might be more than one worker in a database concurrently,
 * and the same module may request more than one worker running the same (or
 * different) code.
