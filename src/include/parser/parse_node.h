/*
 * State information used during parse analysis
 *
 * parentParseState: NULL in a top-level ParseState.  When parsing a subquery,
 * links to current parse state of outer query.
 *
 * p_sourcetext: source string that generated the raw parsetree being
 * analyzed, or NULL if not available.  (The string is used only to
 * generate cursor positions in error messages: we need it to convert
 * byte-wise locations in parse structures to character-wise cursor
 * positions.)
 *
 * p_rtable: list of RTEs that will become the rangetable of the query.
 * Note that neither relname nor refname of these entries are necessarily
 * unique; searching the rtable by name is a bad idea.
 *
 * p_joinexprs: list of JoinExpr nodes associated with p_rtable entries.
 * This is one-for-one with p_rtable, but contains NULLs for non-join
 * RTEs, and may be shorter than p_rtable if the last RTE(s) aren't joins.
 *
 * p_joinlist: list of join items (RangeTblRef and JoinExpr nodes) that
 * will become the fromlist of the query's top-level FromExpr node.
 *
 * p_namespace: list of ParseNamespaceItems that represents the current
 * namespace for table and column lookup.  (The RTEs listed here may be just
 * a subset of the whole rtable.  See ParseNamespaceItem comments below.)
 *
 * p_lateral_active: TRUE if we are currently parsing a LATERAL subexpression
 * of this parse level.  This makes p_lateral_only namespace items visible,
 * whereas they are not visible when p_lateral_active is FALSE.
 *
 * p_ctenamespace: list of CommonTableExprs (WITH items) that are visible
 * at the moment.  This is entirely different from p_namespace because a CTE
 * is not an RTE, rather "visibility" means you could make an RTE from it.
 *
 * p_future_ctes: list of CommonTableExprs (WITH items) that are not yet
 * visible due to scope rules.  This is used to help improve error messages.
 *
 * p_parent_cte: CommonTableExpr that immediately contains the current query,
 * if any.
 *
 * p_target_relation: target relation, if query is INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
 *
 * p_target_rangetblentry: target relation's entry in the rtable list.
 *
 * p_is_insert: true to process assignment expressions like INSERT, false
 * to process them like UPDATE.  (Note this can change intra-statement, for
 * cases like INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE.)
 *
 * p_windowdefs: list of WindowDefs representing WINDOW and OVER clauses.
 * We collect these while transforming expressions and then transform them
 * afterwards (so that any resjunk tlist items needed for the sort/group
 * clauses end up at the end of the query tlist).  A WindowDef's location in
 * this list, counting from 1, is the winref number to use to reference it.
 *
 * p_expr_kind: kind of expression we're currently parsing, as per enum above;
 * EXPR_KIND_NONE when not in an expression.
 *
 * p_next_resno: next TargetEntry.resno to assign, starting from 1.
 *
 * p_multiassign_exprs: partially-processed MultiAssignRef source expressions.
 *
 * p_locking_clause: query's FOR UPDATE/FOR SHARE clause, if any.
 *
 * p_locked_from_parent: true if parent query level applies FOR UPDATE/SHARE
 * to this subquery as a whole.
 *
 * p_resolve_unknowns: resolve unknown-type SELECT output columns as type TEXT
 * (this is true by default).
 *
 * p_hasAggs, p_hasWindowFuncs, etc: true if we've found any of the indicated
 * constructs in the query.
 *
 * p_last_srf: the set-returning FuncExpr or OpExpr most recently found in
 * the query, or NULL if none.
 *
 * p_pre_columnref_hook, etc: optional parser hook functions for modifying the
 * interpretation of ColumnRefs and ParamRefs.
 *
 * p_ref_hook_state: passthrough state for the parser hook functions.

 * An element of a namespace list.

 * Namespace items with p_rel_visible set define which RTEs are accessible by
 * qualified names, while those with p_cols_visible set define which RTEs are
 * accessible by unqualified names.  These sets are different because a JOIN
 * without an alias does not hide the contained tables (so they must be
 * visible for qualified references) but it does hide their columns
 * (unqualified references to the columns refer to the JOIN, not the member
 * tables, so we must not complain that such a reference is ambiguous).
 * Various special RTEs such as NEW/OLD for rules may also appear with only
 * one flag set.
 *
 * While processing the FROM clause, namespace items may appear with
 * p_lateral_only set, meaning they are visible only to LATERAL
 * subexpressions.  (The pstate's p_lateral_active flag tells whether we are
 * inside such a subexpression at the moment.)    If p_lateral_ok is not set,
 * it's an error to actually use such a namespace item.  One might think it
 * would be better to just exclude such items from visibility, but the wording
 * of SQL:2008 requires us to do it this way.  We also use p_lateral_ok to
 * forbid LATERAL references to an UPDATE/DELETE target table.
 *
 * At no time should a namespace list contain two entries that conflict
 * according to the rules in checkNameSpaceConflicts; but note that those
 * are more complicated than "must have different alias names", so in practice
 * code searching a namespace list has to check for ambiguous references.
