 * buffile.h
 *      Management of large buffered files, primarily temporary files.
 *
 * The BufFile routines provide a partial replacement for stdio atop
 * virtual file descriptors managed by fd.c.  Currently they only support
 * buffered access to a virtual file, without any of stdio's formatting
 * features.  That's enough for immediate needs, but the set of facilities
 * could be expanded if necessary.
 *
 * BufFile also supports working with temporary files that exceed the OS
 * file size limit and/or the largest offset representable in an int.
 * It might be better to split that out as a separately accessible module,
 * but currently we have no need for oversize temp files without buffered
 * access.
