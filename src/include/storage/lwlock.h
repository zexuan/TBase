/*
 * In most cases, it's desirable to force each tranche of LWLocks to be aligned
 * on a cache line boundary and make the array stride a power of 2.  This saves
 * a few cycles in indexing, but more importantly ensures that individual
 * LWLocks don't cross cache line boundaries.  This reduces cache contention
 * problems, especially on AMD Opterons.  In some cases, it's useful to add
 * even more padding so that each LWLock takes up an entire cache line; this is
 * useful, for example, in the main LWLock array, where the overall number of
 * locks is small but some are heavily contended.
 *
 * When allocating a tranche that contains data other than LWLocks, it is
 * probably best to include a bare LWLock and then pad the resulting structure
 * as necessary for performance.  For an array that contains only LWLocks,
 * LWLockMinimallyPadded can be used for cases where we just want to ensure
 * that we don't cross cache line boundaries within a single lock, while
 * LWLockPadded can be used for cases where we want each lock to be an entire
 * cache line.
 *
 * An LWLockMinimallyPadded might contain more than the absolute minimum amount
 * of padding required to keep a lock from crossing a cache line boundary,
 * because an unpadded LWLock will normally fit into 16 bytes.  We ignore that
 * possibility when determining the minimal amount of padding.  Older releases
 * had larger LWLocks, so 32 really was the minimum, and packing them in
 * tighter might hurt performance.
 *
 * LWLOCK_MINIMAL_SIZE should be 32 on basically all common platforms, but
 * because pg_atomic_uint32 is more than 4 bytes on some obscure platforms, we
 * allow for the possibility that it might be 64.  Even on those platforms,
 * we probably won't exceed 32 bytes unless LOCK_DEBUG is defined.
