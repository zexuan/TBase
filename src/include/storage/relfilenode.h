/*
 * RelFileNode must provide all that we need to know to physically access
 * a relation, with the exception of the backend ID, which can be provided
 * separately. Note, however, that a "physical" relation is comprised of
 * multiple files on the filesystem, as each fork is stored as a separate
 * file, and each fork can be divided into multiple segments. See md.c.
 *
 * spcNode identifies the tablespace of the relation.  It corresponds to
 * pg_tablespace.oid.
 *
 * dbNode identifies the database of the relation.  It is zero for
 * "shared" relations (those common to all databases of a cluster).
 * Nonzero dbNode values correspond to pg_database.oid.
 *
 * relNode identifies the specific relation.  relNode corresponds to
 * pg_class.relfilenode (NOT pg_class.oid, because we need to be able
 * to assign new physical files to relations in some situations).
 * Notice that relNode is only unique within a database in a particular
 * tablespace.
 *
 * Note: spcNode must be GLOBALTABLESPACE_OID if and only if dbNode is
 * zero.  We support shared relations only in the "global" tablespace.
 *
 * Note: in pg_class we allow reltablespace == 0 to denote that the
 * relation is stored in its database's "default" tablespace (as
 * identified by pg_database.dattablespace).  However this shorthand
 * is NOT allowed in RelFileNode structs --- the real tablespace ID
 * must be supplied when setting spcNode.
 *
 * Note: in pg_class, relfilenode can be zero to denote that the relation
 * is a "mapped" relation, whose current true filenode number is available
 * from relmapper.c.  Again, this case is NOT allowed in RelFileNodes.
 *
 * Note: various places use RelFileNode in hashtable keys.  Therefore,
 * there *must not* be any unused padding bytes in this struct.  That
 * should be safe as long as all the fields are of type Oid.

 * are always transient and removed in case of a database crash; they are
