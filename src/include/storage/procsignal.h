/*
 * Reasons for signalling a Postgres child process (a backend or an auxiliary
 * process, like checkpointer).  We can cope with concurrent signals for different
 * reasons.  However, if the same reason is signaled multiple times in quick
 * succession, the process is likely to observe only one notification of it.
 * This is okay for the present uses.
 *
 * Also, because of race conditions, it's important that all the signals be
 * defined so that no harm is done if a process mistakenly receives one.
